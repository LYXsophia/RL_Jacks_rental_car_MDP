# Reinforcement learing :Jacks_rental_car_MDP -- Value Iteration

#### The description of the problem is in the section 4.3 of  _An Introduction of Reinforcement Learning_ Second edition by Sutton and Barto

Assumptions and Algorithm:
In Value Iteration, we first iterate state value V using (1) and then  determines the policies using greediy policy
